# Zero Yield Curve Extractor

- This project calculates zero-coupon bond values and extracts zero rates from bond data using Python.
- It includes functions for bond valuation, zero rate extraction, and visualization of the zero yield curve.

---

## Files
- `zero_yield.py`: Main script for computing zero-coupon bond values and extracting zero rates.
- `output.png`: Plot.
---

## Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `plotly.graph_objects` (Plotly)

---

## Functionality
- **Zero-Coupon Bond Valuation**: Computes the present value of a zero-coupon bond given face value, interest rate, and time to maturity.
- **Zero Rate Extraction**: Extracts zero rates from a dataset of bonds with varying maturities and coupon rates.
- **Visualization**: Plots the zero yield curve using Plotly, showing zero rates across different maturities.
